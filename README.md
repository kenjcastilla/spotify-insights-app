# spotify-insights-app
Provide a Django app that shows personal listening insights from Spotify.
I used Spotipy to perform requests to Spotify's API, as opposed to using my own requests in my Foodmixr project.

To use, add a .env file to the root directory with the following variables:
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID,
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET,
    SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI
